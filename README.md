🎄 Advent of Code 2025 - Algorithmic Solutions



📌 About The Project
This repository documents my journey through the Advent of Code 2025.
My main goal here is not just to find the answer, but to write efficient, readable, and scalable code. I treat each puzzle as a software engineering challenge, focusing on:

Big O Notation: Optimizing time and space complexity.
Clean Code: Using meaningful variable names and modular functions.
Pythonic Patterns: Utilizing List Comprehensions, Generators, and Type Hinting.

📂 Progress & Key Concepts
Below is a summary of the challenges solved so far, highlighting the technical concepts applied to solve them efficiently.

Note: Days 5-7 were skipped to prioritize the more algorithmic-heavy challenges of the second week.

🚀 How to Run
I structured the project to be modular. To run a specific day's solution:
