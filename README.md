## 📌 About The Project

This repository documents my journey through the **Advent of Code 2025**. 

My main goal here is not just to find the answer, but to write **efficient, readable, and scalable code**. I treat each puzzle as a software engineering challenge, focusing on:

*   **Big O Notation:** Optimizing time and space complexity.
*   **Clean Code:** Using meaningful variable names and modular functions.
*   **Pythonic Patterns:** Utilizing List Comprehensions, Generators, and Type Hinting.

## 📂 Progress & Key Concepts

Below is a summary of the challenges solved so far, highlighting the technical concepts applied to solve them efficiently.

| Day | Challenge Focus | Key Concepts & Libraries | Time Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | Input Parsing & Arrays | `List Comprehension`, `Zip`, `Sorting` | O(N log N) |
| **02** | Conditional Logic | `Control Flow`, `Data Validation` | O(N) |
| **03** | String Manipulation | `Regex (re module)`, `Pattern Matching` | O(N) |
| **04** | Set Theory / Grids | `Sets`, `Intersection/Union`, `Matrix Traversal` | O(N*M) |
| **08** | Data Structures | `HashMaps (Dictionaries)`, `Frequency Analysis` | O(N) |
| **09** | Recursion / Stack | `Recursion`, `Stack Implementation`, `Backtracking` | O(N) |
| **10** | Graph Theory / BFS | `Breadth-First Search (BFS)`, `Queue`, `2D Grid Navigation` | O(V + E) |

> *Note: Days 5-7 were skipped to prioritize the more algorithmic-heavy challenges of the second week.*

## 🚀 How to Run

I structured the project to be modular. To run a specific day's solution:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FLS-7/advent-of-code-2025-py.git
